# Pig the Dice

---

> Pig is a simple dice game first described in print by John Scarne in 1945.

#### Players take turns to roll a single dice as many times as they wish, adding all roll results to a running total, but losing their gained score for the turn if they roll a 1.

##### As with many games of folk origin, Pig is played with many rule variations, including the use of two dice instead of one. Commercial variants of two-dice Pig include Pass the Pigs, Pig Dice, and Skunk. Pig is commonly used by mathematics teachers to teach probability concepts.

## How To Play

Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":

- If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.
- If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.
- If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.
  The first player to score 100 or more points wins.

#### If Player A rolls the dice 3 times and rolls 2, 3 or 4, the temporary score for that turn is 2 3 4 = 9 points. In this situation, if player A chooses to hold, player A scores 9 points on that turn and moves on to the next player's turn. However, if Player A rolls a dice and rolls a 1 on the dice, no points are scored for that turn and the next player's turn is passed. If player A is the first among the players to score 100 points, he wins the game, otherwise he loses the game.
